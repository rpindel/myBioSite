              <figcaption><br>I was immediately enthralled by the Pokémon games when they launched in 1996 and while I took a break as I grew older, I have recently returned to the franchise enforce as an adult.  The impetus for this return was initially wanting to share the love I had for the original games with my own children since a new generation launched.  Due to our consumption of YouTube content creatores as our main "TV media" my rteturn to the franchise has returned more strongly to my enjoyment as well since it is a very popular with many creators.  Frankly, I like Pokémon.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>I discovered hiking as a hobby during the lockdown years of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Like many others, I saw it as a way to stay physically active but socially distanced.  I enjoy being outside and exploring nature and hiking seemed to be a natural extension of those desires.  I had hoped my children would take to it like I did but apparently just walking around is not entertaining enough for them.  I still grealt enjoy the activity and will continue to do it solo and drag my children whenever the stars align.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>A hobby that I picked up after my divorce was daytripping.  I like to identify fun places around the state (or even slightly out of state) and taking a drive to explore.  I usually have a primary goal when I go somewhere, i.e. I read an article online (www.onlyinyourstate.com is a great resource), and then use that primary goal as a springboard for other activities.  I really enjoying historical sites and learning the local history.  I also try and find a local brewpub to consume local pub fare and brews.</figcaption>
