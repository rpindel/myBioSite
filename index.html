              <figcaption><br>I was immediately enthralled by the Pokémon games when they launched in 1996 and while I took a break as I grew older, I have recently returned to the franchise enforce as an adult. The impetus for this return was initially wanting to share the love I had for the original games with my own children since a new generation launched. Due to our consumption of YouTube content creators as our main "TV media" my return to the franchise has returned more strongly to my enjoyment as well since it is very popular with many creators. Frankly, I like Pokémon. My favorite 'mon is Mew and its coloring influenced the color palette for this project.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>I discovered hiking as a hobby during the lockdown years of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Like many others, I saw it as a way to stay physically active but socially distanced.  I enjoy being outside and exploring nature and hiking seemed to be a natural extension of those desires.  I had hoped my children would take to it like I did but apparently just walking around is not entertaining enough for them.  I still greatly enjoy the activity and will continue to do it solo and drag my children whenever the stars align.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>A hobby that I picked up after my divorce was daytripping.  I like to identify fun places around the state (or even slightly out of state) and take a drive to explore.  I usually have a primary goal when I go somewhere, i.e. I read an article online (www.onlyinyourstate.com is a great resource), and then use that primary goal as a springboard for other activities.  I really enjoy historical sites and learning the local history.  I also try to find a local brewpub to consume local pub fare and brews.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>I made a career change in January 2009 when I left banking and entered the world of IT as a help desk consultant.  Thankfully I joined a large company with a varied IT department that allowed me to develop and learn new areas.  As such, I have been able to stay with a single company so far for my IT career and am engaged in this Bellevue program to learn additional skill sets that I can take back to my current role.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>Arguably my most enjoyable and valuable life experience is my time as a father.  I absolutely love my children and cannot imagine life without them.  I can barely remember life before them to be honest.  They have taught me not only how to be a father and all that comes with that directly but also how to be a better person (what I do and say directly impacts and influences them) and a more engaged member of the community (their elementary school is very parent-involved).</figcaption>

              <figcaption><br>As part of my divorce, we decided I could keep the house if I was able to afford it.  I did the research and discovered I was and have since been living the fabulous life of solo home ownership.  This experience is incredibly worthwhile to learn about my personal limits and also what I might need to know to better assist my family and children later in life.  This image is my new sump pump, replacing the one that broke while I was on a work call (the sump pump is in a closet in my basement office).</figcaption>
